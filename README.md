### Declaritive Framework for Flutter
Compose your app with ease and leave the plumbing up to the framework

### Separation of Concerns
Separate your app's logic from its presentation

### BloC Approach to State Management
Send events to the business logic component and let the framework handle UI changes from the stream

### Compose Your Dependencies
Access you dependencies with dependency injection when you need them in the app

### Declarative Approach to Navigation
Specify page names and `StatelessWidget`s to seamlessly transition between pages. Respond to navigation from BloC handlers instead of UI callbacks
